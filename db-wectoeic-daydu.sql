A green roof is one that\'s covered with grasses, flowers, or other plants. It lowers heating and cooling costs while increasing a structure\'s aesthetic appeal. This Web site is designed for sharing ideas, photos, and resources to create and maintain a green roof.<br>Planting a rooftop garden is a rewarding do-it-yourself project, but special waterproofing and other preparations require the services of an experienced contractor.

Neither arrangement is necessary, as I am happy to deliver your items to you in Stranraer myself. It so happens that my sister and her children live nearby in Kilwinning. Before seeing them, I will drive my rental car to your house and hand deliver the items to you.<br>As you know, my merchandise is 100 percent handcrafted.

My husband and I arrived there at 7 P.M. yesterday, keen to enjoy live music with our dinner. Unfortunately, the band\'s performance that night had been cancelled. Undeterred, we stayed and both ordered the jerk chicken. While the chicken\'s smoky flavour was outstanding, the stewed cabbage was lacking in flavour. Also, the portion size was smaller than we had anticipated, so we ordered another appetiser to avoid going home hungry. The head chef came out to apologise and was extremely nice, but we will probably not go back anytime soon.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<p>\n<br>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">E-Mail Message</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>To: tpeterkin@sunmail.co.uk<br>From:v smith@orangebaykitchen.co.uk<br>Date: 24 August<br>Subject: Your review<br>Attachment: 0258</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dear Ms. Peterkin.</p>\n<p>\n<br>Thank you for visiting Orange Bay Kitchen and leaving a review.

As you can see from the attached document, the results are very disappointing. We sent the four flavours that we considered to be the best, but none of them received high enough ratings to advance to the next stage of development. Most of the reviews were consistent among the 92 taste-test participants in our target market of consumers ages 25 through 40. It\'s not a big problem if a product gets low scores in colour in the testing phase, since we can easily adjust that in the laboratory.

Thank you.<br>Date: 18 June<br>Name and role: Beth Mair, sales manager<br>I have noticed that some employees grab a new pair of disposable gloves every time they return from a break. They could be using the same ones throughout the whole day. By limiting the use of gloves to one pair per day, Woolf Flooring would save thousands of dollars per year. Doing so would also reduce waste. A new policy regarding the use of personal protective items would be easy to implement impleme immediately and would simply require sending a company-wide e-mail to explain it.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<strong>Miyoko Consulting&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Woolf Flooring Report Summary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>Thank you for allowing us to spend the last few weeks reviewing your operations. You will find a detailed expense-reduction report with projected savings in the pages that follow. Here is a list of our main recommendations.<br>1. Employees do not always use wood stains and other materials as efficiently as possible. More training time could be dedicated to this.<br>2. Employees could be more mindful of electricity costs for instance, turning off all lights and machines when not in use.<br>3. Several Internet service providers are offering special pricing right now. Switching to one of these providers could save a considerable amount of money in the long run.<br>4. More effort could be made to reuse supplies-for example, some basic personal protective equipment could be used more than once.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>','',1,'','2024-07-15

To make up for this, we\'re providing complimentary meal vouchers so you can enjoy a free lunch, on us, when we get to the area around the cannery.</p>',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6101,'(B) their','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) they','(B) their','(C) theirs','(D) themselves',101,'','The new policy allows employees to set -------- own working hours under certain conditions.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6102,'(B) for','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) when','(B) for','(C) if','(D) or',102,'','Based on last year\'s data, Palk Company increased its sales projections -------- the current year.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6103,'(C) during','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) among','(B) beside','(C) during','(D) only',103,'','Harbison\'s Department Store interviews applicants -------- standard business hours.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6104,'(C) wider','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) wideness','(B) widen','(C) wider','(D) widely',104,'','Takealong Industries\' commercial propane heaters deliver more warmth to --------areas.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6105,'(B) greatly','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) great','(B) greatly','(C) greater','(D) greatest',105,'','By switching to new project-management software, the editorial team has -------- improved its publication processes.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6106,'(C) has nominated','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) nominating','(B) nomination','(C) has nominated','(D) has been nominated',106,'','The search committee -------- three candidates for the chief executive position.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6107,'(C) After','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) Additionally','(B) Although','(C) After','(D) Furthermore',107,'','-------- a two-month delay, new carpeting was installed in the east conference room.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6108,'(D) enrollment','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) enroll','(B) enrolled','(C) enrolling','(D) enrollment',108,'','To boost ---------, the Makeup Artist Academy is offering a free starter kit to new students.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6109,'(A) guarantees','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) guarantees','(B) advises','(C) requires','(D) delays',109,'','Because Lectula Furniture Company ------ its delivery times, we were able to set a firm opening date for the new hotel.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6110,'(A) friendly','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) friendly','(B) neutral','(C) possible','(D) frequent',110,'','The computer technician was very ------but was not able to solve my problem.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6111,'(A) regular','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) regular','(B) regularly','(C) regularize','(D) regularly',111,'','To make room for conference attendees, ------ visitors to the office building should use the rear parking area tomorrow.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6112,'(A) clearly','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) clearly','(B) recently','(C) evenly','(D) secretly',112,'','Employees must wear their security badge in a way that is ------ visible when in the building.','','',5,'','',1,'','2024-07-16 01:55:54',43),(6113,'(C) however','2024-07-16 01:55:54','(A) therefore','(B) following','(C) however','(D) for example',113,'','Ms. Phon wanted to attend the gallery opening;

The designated trails include some of the most popular hiking spots in the area. The permits are free of charge and require only that hikers register online at www.uptonparks.org or at any Upton Parks Department office. Upon registering, hikers will receive a permit that they can print out or display on a mobile device.</td>\n<td>The move is part of an effort to reduce foot traffic on the most used trails, but some hikers are concerned. \"I might not be able to get a permit for my favorite trails if none are left when I want to go,\" says Regina Faroni. an Upton parks hiker. \"In addition, I often check the weather in the morning and then decide if it\'s a good day to hike,\" she says. Having to apply for a permit could prevent her from taking spontaneous hikes. \"On the other hand, it would reduce the number of hikers on certain trails,\" Faroni admits. -EJ Harjo, Upton Digest</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<figure class=\"table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>From:</strong>\n</td>\n<td>Arlo Gomes &lt;arlog@uptonhikingclub.org&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>To:</strong>\n</td>\n<td>Upton Parks Department &lt;info@uptonparks.org&gt;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Subject:</strong>\n</td>\n<td>Hiking permits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<strong>Date:</strong>\n</td>\n<td>January 22</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>\n<p>I read in the Upton Digest that hikers soon will be required to register for permits to hike on certain trails.

Too many companies make the mistake of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach rather than tailoring tours to maximize their usefulness. A potential investor and a casual tourist will probably not be impressed by the same things, so it is best to be clear about the tour\'s purpose early on. Here are some guidelines to make each tour as effective as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Be selective.</strong> Unless your tour is for a safety inspection, your guests do not need (or want) to see every part of your factory. Choose a few sections that will interest your guests and give them a better sense of your product. For example, journalists will want to create a story about your plant, so show them the parts of the plant that have historical significance, such as a room with the company\'s original production equipment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Timing is everything.</strong> Always be mindful of the physical demands of the tour. Even the hardiest guest will tire of standing or walking for long periods. It is a good idea to schedule breaks in tours lasting longer than an hour. The time spent in a single section matters also. If you allow guests only five minutes in an area, they will soon forget it. On the other hand, even the most impressive room gets boring after half an hour.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personality is NOT everything.</strong> While having a personable and friendly tour guide is essential, your guests are coming to see what goes into making your product. Tour guides get asked a variety of questions, some unexpected, so a comprehensive knowledge of the production processes is important (and absolutely vital during inspections).

I love traveling to Dallas every year for this conference because it is a great networking opportunity. Since this is your first time attending. I recommend you go to the newcomers reception on the first night. The conference executive planning committee is putting it on. and it could be an excellent occasion to socialize with other conference goers.</p>\n<p>I will be staying at the Alessi Dallas Hotel. It is the closest to the convention center, and the rooms are comfortable. For you, I would suggest the one you already seem to prefer. It so happens that the newcomers\' reception will be held in one of the event rooms there. It is a little farther away but still convenient. As a friendly reminder, we are advised not to book hotels with rates that exceed our company\'s limit of $175/night.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you in October. It will be lovely to catch up.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Hae-won Jeong<br>Digital Marketing Director<br>The 3R Marketing Firm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>','',1,'','2024-07-16 02:21:44',46),(6799,'(C) To confirm the start of a service','2024-07-16 02:21:44','(A) To list customer benefits','(B) To alert customers to a price change','(C) To confirm the start of a service','(D) To describe changes to a Web site',196,'','What is one purpose of the letter?','','',7,'<figure class=\"table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Dover Water Supply<br>7400 Rodney Boulevard, Dover, DE 19904</p>\n<p>March 12</p>\n<p>Ms. Na-Ri Cam&nbsp;<br>361 Farming Avenue&nbsp;<br>Dover, DE 19902</p>\n<p>Dear Ms. Cam,</p>\n<p>This letter is to confirm that Dover Water Supply will begin service at your address on Wednesday, April 6.

I have to say that I agree with this statement. If you work at a job you enjoy, you will probably do your job better than if you work at a job only to earn money. You will also feel happier. Money has its uses, but everyone knows that it doesn’t buy happiness.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most people do their work better when they have a job they enjoy. If they are interested in their work, they are willing to put more effort into it. They will take the time to learn more about their profession and improve their skills. They don’t mind spending extra time on the job when that is required. Overall, they have a good attitude toward their job, and that can improve the way they do it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When people enjoy their jobs, they feel happier. They are happy to go to work. They are also happy outside of work hours because they don’t feel the stresses of an unpleasant job. Since most people spend a large percentage of their lives at their jobs, it is important to have a job that brings happiness.<br>Earning a lot of money is a goal for many people, but money does not lead to a happy life. If you focus on making money, you may miss the opportunity to bring other things into your life, such as self-fulfillment, love and friendships, and just relaxing and enjoying yourself.

The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry.<br>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29.<br>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow.<br><br>===========================<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</h3><p><br>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift at Polito’s Pizza.
